# Trying to work out how to get arrays to work with printing strings from jobs and dependencies and how
# to get them to work together also
#At this stage all commented code is just showing my thought processes at this point
# I want a user to be able to input a job or jobs and get them printed out with relevant dependencies or none at all
# or if a user inputs nothing - then nothing to be printed maybe apart from a simple message

# The above code at this moment will print out a job with a dependency of choice
# no user input as yet

# I think I'm on the right track here but a lot of work to be done to get the user input involved
# and also to get the correct dependencies working alongside the jobs that depend on them.
